# OpenRansomWare
Hypothetical open source business model for an open source software class.

## Buisness Model

The bisness model of Open Ransomware is to create a brand of white hat hacker tools that are very accessible for "script kiddies" to use. This will include a ransomeware script that asks users to send NFTs to out Etherium wallet, but does not modify or lock the target's files. We will not use the ransomeware ourselves, instead we will say 'this is an example of ransomware we made public so developers can test defenses against it'. But we will depend on the aformentioned script kiddies to download it and use it themselves, hope that they don't modify which Etherium wallet the ransomeware points to and we will hope their targets don't realize the code doesn't actually do anything to thier files and pay up. This will give us their NFTs that we can then resell. 

If the person using our script does modify the Etherium wallet, then we have the Appache 2.0 license on our side. If they fail to state their changes and/or fail to remove our trademarks, we can then use the Appache 2.0 license to sue them and generate revenue that way. 

And lastly, if all else fails, we will also include a crypto miner in our Open Ransomware framework that will be on by default and send us Bitcoin. Again, this is hoping that script kiddies don't bother actually reading our code and terms of service.
